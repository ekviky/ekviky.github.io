# Viral integrations  

Similar to TEs, viruses can insert themselves into the genomic sequence of their host. Indeed, viruses are thought to be ancient precursors of some TEs. Integration can be an important step in the viral life cycle, for example the mechanism of HPV-associated cancers (nearly all cervical, and a majority of oralpharangeal) depends upon it. However, questions such as how often, how many, where, and when remain unanswered. Viral integrations detected in WGS data collected from clinical samples and tissues can help to fill in the remaining gaps in our knowledge of viral dynamics in affected and healthy individual genomes.
