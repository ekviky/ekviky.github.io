		<h1>About</h1>
		<h2>The long and short of it</h2>
		<p>I'm a computational genomicist, interested in leveraging genome sequence information to understand the narrative of the human genome - <strong>what</strong> is it made of, <strong>how</strong> did it get there, and <strong>why</strong> is it still here. If one woman's trash is another's treasure, then I have had a rich career indeed, focusing on nuisance events, junk DNA, the alignment "bin" - the pariah of the genome.<p>
		<p>Why, you ask? Well, I believe it's important to understand the impact of sequence changes of <i>all</i> sizes. These structural variations contribute to species evolution, population differences, and phenotypes including genetic disease. My <a href="/projects">research</a> has touched upon evolutionary, population, and most recently, clinical applications of genomics.<p>
