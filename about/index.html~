		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>I'm a computational genomicist, interested in leveraging genome sequence information to understand the narrative of the human genome - the who, what, when, where, why and how. If one woman's junk is another's treasure, then I have had a rich career indeed, focusing on the nuisance events, the junk DNA, the alignment "bin" - the pariah of the genome. You live in this city with these animals and people. In your free time you like X, Y, and Z.<p>
