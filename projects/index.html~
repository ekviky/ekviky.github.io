		<h1>Projects</h1>
		<p>My main research interest is to understand the impact of structural variation (insertions, deletions, transposable elements, large rearrangements, etc.) on genomes and phenotypes. To do so, I have built computational tools and pipelines to interrogate whole genome sequence data for signatures of the who, what, when, where, why and how. Below I outline previous and ongoing projects focusing on these tricky bits of the genome - nuisance events, junk DNA, inaccessible regions - and provide open-source bioinformatics tools and collaborations.<p>

			<h2><li>TEs</li></h2>
			<p>Transposable elements (TEs) are ubiquitous in the human genome and potentially have a great impact on gene expression (via disruption of exons and/or splice signals, donation of novel transcription start sites), yet their contribution to disease is poorly understood. With  <a href="http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/gerton-lunter#research">Gerton Lunter</a>, I have developed a high-throughput molecular and computational genomics approach to detect TEs in whole genome sequencing (WGS) data. In collaboration with clinical researchers at the WTCHG, we have applied these tools to WGS of individuals with clinical phenotypes spanning a wide range of disorders, to help find potential causal variants and to illuminate the contribution of TEs to human disease.<p> 

			<h2><li>Clinical NGS tools</li></h2>
			<h2><li>Small indels</li></h2>
			<p> Insertions and deletions (collectively "indels") have played a major role in shaping the evolution genomes. Not just nuisance events, we know that indels have shaped and been shaped by regional differences in genomic landscape features. Patterns of indel mutation and fixation dynamics can provide clues to the evolution of genome architecture (link to LD paper), and the underlying sources of population-scale variation (link to 1KG paper). With <a href="http://www.bx.psu.edu/makova_lab/">Kateryna Makova</a>, I developed software to identify and polarize indel mutations in multiple-species alignments (link to paper).<p>
